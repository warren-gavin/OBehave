/// Make a UIStackView always expand to full screen, if the content is
/// too small, or scrollable when it's too large.
///
/// This is sometimes preferable to a typical table view when you
/// would prefer the simple layout of a stack view, plus no scrolling
/// if the content isn't too large.
///
/// With this approach a smaller font size may show as laid out in a
/// normal stack view, while another instance running with a larger font
/// size for accessibility purposes will result in a view that is still
/// laid out the same, but now scrolls to show all the content
///
/// To use in a storyboard:
///
/// - Add a scroll view to a view controller, anchored to the
///   top and bottom layout guides. The width can be whatever you like.
/// - Add a vertical stack view as a subview of the scroll view, with layout
///   constraints equal to the top, bottom, leading and trailing space, plus
///   equal widths
/// - The stack view's alignment should be fill, the distribution equal spacing
/// - Start adding elements.
///
/// To make the stack view full screen, for example to push buttons to the
/// bottom of the screen:
///
/// - Add a small UIView with a fixed height to the stack view between the
///   elements you want at the top of the screen and those at the bottom.
/// - Hook up the view's height constraint to the constraint outlet collection
/// - Hooking up multiple such padding views will separate the elements further into
///   evenly spaced groups that fill the screen if the content isn't too large.
/// - If the content is too large, there is no change
